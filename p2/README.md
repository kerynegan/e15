## Notes for instructor
I originally tried to do this using POST. I was quickly able to recreate the functionality to dump the request, but kept getting errors trying to write the POST request to the page (I had a few errors, I assume from the way I set up my routes and views, such as my variables kept returning as null, the POST method is not supported for this route, etc.) 

I tried a few different ways, wanting to solve it myself, but ultimately switched back to the GET form, similar to the bookmark's search method. If I had left myself more time, I'd have asked for help.

That said, I really loved this project. If project 3 is set up similarly, in a 'choose anything with these guidelines' I might try expanding this site to incoporate lots of different types of ciphers.
