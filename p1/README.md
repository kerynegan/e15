## Outside resources
+ In removing special characters for the palindrome function, I came across the [str_replace function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php), and that led me to the [preg_replace function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php).
+ I also needed [this reference](https://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.escape.php), which, **wow**, has so very many things I do not understand, but which led me after about an hour of trial and error to the '\W' non word escape pattern.

+ After a fiddling a lot with a string of the alphabet that I turned into second string with uppercase letters which I then concatenated and turned into an array for a foreach loop, I was so excited to instead find [chr()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.chr.php) and [ord()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ord.php)! 
+ Combined them with [str_split()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-split.php) and [implode()](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.implode.php)
+ Also referred to this [ASCII table](http://www.asciitable.com/)
+ Referred to [Logical operators](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.operators.logical.php)
+ Referred to [Name Game rules](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Name_Game#Rules) for confirmation of my memory in my optional process.
