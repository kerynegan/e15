## Outside resources
+ In removing special characters for the palindrome function, I came across the [str_replace function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.str-replace.php), and that led me to the [preg_replace function](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.preg-replace.php).
+ I also needed [this reference](https://www.php.net/manual/en/regexp.reference.escape.php), which, **wow**, has so very many things I do not understand, but which led me after about an hour of trial and error to the '\W' non word escape pattern.

## Notes for instructor
*any notes for me to refer to while grading; if none, omit this section*
